# Build your own world

Implement the final project from [Berkeley CS61B Spring 2024](https://sp24.datastructur.es/projects/proj3/) 


The official spec starts with a mode of interacting with the world of passing a fixed string of keyboard input as program arguments, 
returning the state of the world after executing of said string. We can just start working directly on the interacive mode of playing 
the game real-time through keyboard input.

**Explore lab09 and lab10**. These labs explore the rendering of the tiles for generating the world and the interactivity of the world, respectively

The world generation algorithm from [Broguelike Dungeon Creation, Part 1](https://anderoonies.github.io/2020/03/17/brogue-generation.html)
looks cool. No need to follow the world rules by the spec.
